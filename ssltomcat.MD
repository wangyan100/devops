  get the related certificate files for your domain

- You generate/export the keystore file by below command

  `openssl pkcs12 -export -in mainriversoft_com.crt -inkey mainriversoft_com_key.txt -certfile mainriversoft_com.ca-bundle -name mrscert -out mainriversoft_com.p12`

  alias name of server certificate is mrscert

  keystore file is mainriversoft_com.p12

- install keystore into tomcat 

  - stop tomcat on ubuntu linux 
  
    `systemctl stop tomcat`

  - modify tomcat/config/server.xml to setup keystore for tomcat
